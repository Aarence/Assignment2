During the design process, i wanted to create a website where people can look for things to buy to their hearts content.
This website is for people who really likes to shop online, the website was made easy to navigate to help the users shop

Feature 1: We added previews of some of the products on the first page of the website, so that the users can see what some of the products
		   we are selling.

Feature 2: Users are able to choose the number of products they want to buy on the product description page, as well as the colour of the product
		   and the size of the product, the size can be small, medium, large or extra-large.
		   
Feature 3: A search function, the user can type in the name of a product in the search bar, where if the product exists, it will redirect them to
           the description page for that product, else there will be a notification under the search bar saying no search results.
		   
Feature 4: Works for both mobile and PC, so users can access the website on Both mobile and on a laptop/desktop

Feature 5: A payment system, the user after clicking pay on the shopping cart page will be redirected to a page where they can choose to pay
		   with either credit card or debit card, after paying on the credit card or debit card page, a notification would be shown
		   saying payment successful
		   
Feature 6: There is a section in the contact us page where the user can submit a request/suggestion or a complain. When the submit button is pressed, there will be
		   a lottie animation of a tick that plays beside a notification that says request submitted successfully. Both the lottie and notification text
		   will disappear after 2.5 seconds, and the form will also reset automatically.
		   
Features left to implement: Trying to make the shopping cart page dynamic so that when add to cart button on product page is pressed,
							the product details and price will show on the shopping cart page.
							
Technology used: Flexbox, restdb api, lottie animation, bootstrap

One of the ways i tested our website was going to the credit card payment page and press pay with the form completely blank to see if there was an error,
then i tried to submit the form with a invalid email address to check that a error appears, and then submitted the form with all the inputs valid,
and checked if a success message was shown.
